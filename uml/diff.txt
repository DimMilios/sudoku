/***************
Consider adding observer for start game event
- Problems:
    - Start controller needs to have access to the listener that handles Key events
    (TextFieldController) to be able to add the listener to every textField. Instead,
    TextFieldController could add itself to the buttons when notified to break the
    dependency.
